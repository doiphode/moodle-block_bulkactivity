Bulk Activity/Resource Creator
==============================

This block plugin allows users to create activities/resources in bulk. In other words, a moodle module can be copied to one or more courses or one or more categories/subcategories in one go.

Requirements
------------
- Moodle 3.3 or later
- Themes based on Boost

Installation
------------
Copy the moodle-block_bulkactivity folder into your /blocks directory, then rename it to bulkactivity and visit your Admin Notification page to complete the installation.

Usage
-----
Once the block is added to a course and when in editing mode, users can click on Edit to see the 'Bulk Copy to Courses' option. By clicking on it, all non-hidden categories on the site will be displayed including their sub-categories with courses. A check-box against every category or course will be available. Users can select them and choose where they want to add the activity/resource.

Here's a demo.
